# Simple_Bullets
-> This game is made by Team Unga_Bunga for GameJam 2023, hosted by IEEE CS BUET SBC.
-> Windows build for the game can be found in Downloads/ directory
-> WebGL build for the game can be played at:

# Game Instructions
-> WASD to move
-> Space, LMB to shoot
-> Shooting will launch the player himself insted of shooting bullets (Our interpretation of the theme: It's not suppose to do that)
-> While launched, the player won't take any damage and will be able to destroy the enemies.
-> After shooting, the gun is dropped and player cannot shoot again until the gun is picked.
-> But if the player collides with the enemies normally, he will take damage.
-> With each wave, both player and the enemies get buffed.
