# Game Instructions
- WASD to move
- Space, LMB to shoot
- Shooting will launch the player himself instead of shooting bullets (Our interpretation of the theme: It's not supposed to do that)
- While launched, the player won't take any damage and will be able to destroy the enemies.
- After shooting, the gun is dropped, and player cannot shoot again until the gun is picked.
- But if the player collides with the enemies normally, he will take damage.
- With each wave, both player and the enemies get buffed.
